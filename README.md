# EasyTrip - A Microservices-Based Travel Management Platform

EasyTrip is a comprehensive travel management platform utilizing a modern microservices architecture. It is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing travel-related services, including user accounts, reservations, destination management, agency services, and user reviews.

The project is built with **Spring Boot** for the backend microservices and **Angular** for the frontend user interface. It leverages **Eureka Server** for service discovery, **Spring Cloud Gateway** for routing, and **Spring Cloud Config** for centralized configuration.

## üöÄ Technologies

* **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Eureka, Gateway, Config)
* **Frontend**: Angular
* **Database**: MySQL, H2 (for specific services)
* **Inter-service Communication**: Feign Client
* **Containerization**: Docker

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple microservices, each with a specific responsibility.

* `ApiGateway-main`: The entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
* `Avis-service`: Manages user reviews and feedback.
* `eurkaServer-main`: The service discovery server, allowing services to find and communicate with each other.
* `FrontEnd`: The Angular-based user interface.
* `gestion-destination-service`: Handles the management of travel destinations.
* `reservation-service`: Manages all travel reservation processes.
* `service-config`: The configuration server for all microservices.
* `Service-agence`: Manages travel agencies and their services.
* `transportService`: Handles transportation-related information and bookings.
* `user-service`: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profiles.
